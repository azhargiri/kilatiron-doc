# Alias Add-on

Adding custom domains to a deployment is supported via the Alias add-on. The
process requires basic knowledge about how the DNS system works. To add a
custom domain follow the following simple steps **for each domain**.

Note: instead of APP_NAME.kilatiron.net (for caching loadbalancers) you
can also use APP_NAME.cloudcontrolapp.com (for non-caching loadbalancers
supporting websockets) as a target for your CNAME.  Details can be found under
[Performance & Caching](https://www.cloudcontrol.com/dev-center/platform-documentation#performance-&-caching).


## Adding an Alias

### Get the verification code

The verification code is unique to the owner of the app. To get it simply use
the alias command.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/default alias APP_NAME.kilatiron.net
~~~

The verification code is case sensitive and includes a space after the colon.
Please ensure, it keeps the exact same syntax in the TXT records text or the
alias will not get verified.

### Add it as a TXT record to your root domain

Please use the interface of your DNS provider to add a [TXT
record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_Record) to your root domain. Please
note how the TXT record is set for `example.com` but used to verify
`www.example.com`.

~~~
example.com.	3600	IN	TXT	"CloudKilat-verification: 68b676e063eadb350876ae291e9ae43748d6e51c85ecd3c4cc026c869acc9d2d"
~~~

Since we are going to use a CNAME to point the custom domain to the provided
`.kilatiron.net` subdomain all additional record types will be ignored.
It's therefor required to set the TXT record on the root domain. This has the
added benefit, that if you can verifiy multiple domains like e.g.
`www.example.com` and `secure.example.com` with just one TXT record set for
`example.com`.

### Add a CNAME pointing to the provided `.kilatiron.net` subdomain

In addition to the TXT record, go ahead and also add a CNAME pointing to your
apps `.kilatiron.net` subdomain. Use the command line client's alias
command to show the one specific to your deployment.

~~~
# for the default deployment
$ ironapp APP_NAME/default alias
Aliases
name                                                         default  verified
APP_NAME.kilatiron.net                                        1        1
# for any additional deployment
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias
Aliases
name                                                         default  verified
DEP_NAME.APP_NAME.kilatiron.net                               1        1
~~~

The resulting CNAME record should look something like this example.

~~~
www.example.com.	1593	IN	CNAME	APP_NAME.kilatiron.net.
~~~

### Add one alias per domain to your deployment

Next add the domain as an alias to your deployment using the alias.add command.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias.add www.example.com
~~~

You should now see your domain in the deployment's list of aliases.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias
Aliases
name                                                         default  verified
www.example.com                                                     0        0
[...]
~~~

The verification takes at least 30 minutes, but depends on the TTL of you DNS
configuration.

### Wait for the DNS changes to propagate

As soon as the changes have propagated through the DNS the alias will be
verified and the deployment will start answering requests to that domain
automatically.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias
Aliases
name                                                         default  verified
www.example.com                                                     0        1
[...]
~~~
 

## Removing an Alias

To remove an alias, simply use the alias.remove command.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias.remove www.example.com
~~~


## Special Case: Wildcard Domains

The alias add-on does support wildcard domains. A wildcard domain like
`*.example.com` allows you to have your deployment answer to arbitrary
subdomains like `something.example.com` and `somethingelse.example.com` without
needing to add every one of them as an alias in advance.

To use this feature first upgrade your alias add-on from free to wildcard.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME addon.upgrade alias.free alias.wildcard 
~~~

Then add the wildcard domain itself as an alias.

~~~
$ ironapp APP_NAME/DEP_NAME alias.add *.example.com
~~~

The TXT record requirement also applies to wildcard domains, so please follow
the steps above accordingly.
